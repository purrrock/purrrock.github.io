I have leave my old home, where there’s gold and a steed,
But the people eat dreams, not the food what they need.
Getting here so much hard — crossing borders and seas,
I was chasing the hope of some kindness and peace.
In this place, they don’t get me; my words flow unclear,
And they look at me strange, like I don’t belong here.

Beneath foreign skies, my song I’ll play,
Violin, mandolin — my bread, my way.
This life isn’t mine, and the world is so cold,
But my heart stays hot, and my spirit is bold.
I’m not of your people, not your blood, your kin.
But my soul is fire —  my love burns within.

Through the day, I lift bricks till my body is sore,
“No rest!” shouts the boss, “You can carry much more!”
All my wage are late, and I’m told just to wait,
If I dare to complain, then they show me the gate.
In a trailer, I sleep, where the concrete is near,
And no one here who care, who hear in my fear.

Beneath foreign skies, my song I’ll play,
Violin, mandolin — my bread, my way.
This life isn’t mine, and the world is so cold,
But my heart stays hot, and my spirit is bold.
I’m not of your people, not your blood, your kin.
But my soul is fire —  my love burns within.

What I earned for my children, I trusted to send,
But thief stole it all; I was tricked in the end.
Now my fam’ly waits hungry, no food left to share,
And my mother keeps watch, whisper prayer in despair.
So I play in the streets for a coin or smile,
Just to make it through hunger, at least for a while.

As they pass, people scoff, or they glance, then look down,
In their glittering world, they just see me — a clown.
Yet my violin sings what my voice cannot say,
And my mandolin echoes the hopes I can play.
Though this land is foreign, my path was so long,
I give them my heart through the strings of my song.

I come to this place, seeking some more,
But the days slip away, my hopes are poor.
I whisper to children, "You be stronger than me,"
Life be hard, but dreams can run free.
They may laugh at me; they may call me is fool,
But my heart burns bright, and the strings still pull.

Beneath foreign skies, my song will remains,
A voice from the dark, born of sorrow and pain.
Though this life is harsh, and the world feels cold,
But music survives; it’s a story retold.
Melody sings while the strings stay alive,
My life tastes bitter, but my dreams survive.
