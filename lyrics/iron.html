Breaking through mountains, my footprints ablaze,
Past melts away in the fate-driven waves.
"Old man, retreat!" coward bastards would cry.
"Come face my wrath, if you dare to defy!"

My youth was forged in a furnace's flame,
Time tried to break me, but I won the game!
In savage peaks, where it's snow and it's gale,
I became steel through life's brutal assail!

Free as the wind in the clouds up on high,
Shattering silence and ripping the sky!
Heart made of titan and will made of stone,
Rock is my blood, it’s the core of my soul!

They call me Elder, a relic of old,
Ancestor mighty from legends untold.
All of your pop beats so tender and weak –
Like mosquitoes when the thunder loud speak!

Each step I take splits the mountains in two,
Lightning runs wild in these veins burning through!
If I had chosen a different way,
I'd be another, not who I am today!

Compass is broken? To hell with it now!
Stars will direct me, they'll show me just how!
Let weaklings tremble in shameful fear,
While I greet sunrise where clouds disappear!

Brothers, let's roar our anthem so bold,
About flames eternal that never grow old!
Z-gen is soft in their comfortable nest,
While Iron Elder conquers mountains' crest!

Furious Elder, forged in tempest and flame,
Tearing the clouds where proud eagles reign!
Heart forged from titan and will made of stone,
Rock is my essence till world comes undone!
