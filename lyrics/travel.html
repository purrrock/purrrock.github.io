I flew around the world, it’s true,
Camera’s ready, that’s my view.
Paris, Goa, Rome, so bright,
Filmed it all, but missed the sight.
A hundred places, all through glass,
But the screen’s what seems to last.
Went viral in a single hour,
Hundreds of likes, I felt the power.
No real talk, no face-to-face,
Just comments flooding, what a race.
The ocean breeze? The sunset glow?
I missed it all, lost in the flow…

Travel blogger, travel blogger,
Coffee for the perfect shot.
Travel blogger, travel blogger,
Selfie taken on the spot.
Travel blogger, travel blogger,
Insta posts, the likes won’t sleep.
Travel blogger, travel blogger,
Through the screen, the world I keep.

In the restaurant, I'm pro,
Filming dishes on the go.
Pizza’s hot, the chef’s delight,
Snap a pic, it's out of sight.
I hit post, the food’s on hold,
Colding now, but the story’s bold.
Ten shots borscht get on my phone,
Lighting’s right, it starts to glow.
Soup is cold, but stream must go,
I tell tales fancy flow.
“Velvet smooth,” I write with pride,
Chewing couscous, late night bite.
What did I eat? I don’t recall,
Insta’s winning, that’s the call.

Travel blogger, travel blogger,
Waiting for that brand to call.
Travel blogger, travel blogger,
Seeking thrills, no time to stall.
Travel blogger, travel blogger,
Life is posted, on the go.
Travel blogger, travel blogger,
Happiness in stories flow.

Up in Himalayas high,
I write: "Look amazing sky!"
The wind’s wild, the snow’s blizzard,
Setting shot, don't need wizard.
They shout: “Where are you now?”
“Streaming live, on air, wow!”
Horizon’s bad, I tilted it,
Twenty five followers quit.
Everest? Too much of chore,
Filters, lighting, more decor... 
The right edits make it shine,
Now the content’s truly mine!
Didn’t climb, but hey, it's post!
It’s moment I like most!

Phone in my pocket, it’s my guide,  
Let Google bless my way, my stride.  
Just need a signal, can’t go wrong,
In the canyon, or where I belong.
Maps will show the way I need,
Where to sleep and where to feed.
Navigator, trusty friend,
Without him, don’t comprehend.
No signal here? I’m despair,
Lost in the woods, I’m everywhere.
The world’s so vast, it’s on my phone,  
Just a tap, and I’m not alone.  

Travel blogger, travel blogger,
Where’s the life beyond the door?
Travel blogger, travel blogger,
Life’s gone by, but what’s the score?
Only posts left, Blogger, Blogger!!!

Through the screen, the world I see.

Didn’t feel it... just the show...

What a post, for Insta’s glow!

Only posts, that’s all, you know!
