On a dusty old rug, where towers of books rise,
I — Pips — built my castle, see how proud it flies!
My throne’s made of pillows, my crown’s made of foil,
No thunder calls here, no blizzard’s freezing toil.
It may not be marble, or pearls shining bright,
But my cardboard castle’s a fortress of might!

I’m the King! My castle — my world with no ends!
From mice to the birds, every creature’s a friend!
My kingdom is born from a fanciful thought,
And in it lives a freedom - the treasure I’ve sought!
And though some may say, “It’s an empty old box!”
My imagination’s the key that unlocks!

From food bowls, I’ve built a rampart on the floor,
To keep the dust-monster away from my door.
I fight with a dragon (a sock, truth be told!),
My moat in the bathroom is wondrous to behold!
The roach-ambassadors I greet with my grace,
Then squash them if tribute is not in its place!

I’m the King! And my castle’s a world you can’t see!
Where everyone’s happy and playing with me!
My kingdom is built out of laughter and dreams,
But my royal edicts are as real as it seems!
And though some may scoff, “It’s merely paper and glue,”
Inside I’m ruler — my law is steady and true!

You are right, little Pips, the true world is inside.
More precious than treasure’s the sparks in your eyes.
They shine like the stars, and they light up the way,
The strongest of walls in your head are to stay.
No storm can destroy them, no rain makes them fall,
For in your own world, you’re the lord of it all.

They say that true riches are things you can hold,
That joy can be purchased with silver and gold.
But my cardboard castle is where I am rich,
Each day brings a quest only I get to reach.
Here everyone plays their own purpose and role,
Just trust in your power and play from the soul!

I am King! My castle — my world never ends!
I don’t need the gold, nor pompous royal trends!
My kingdom is born from a fanciful thought,
Where my heart can sing freely, and never be caught!
And though some may say, "It's an empty old crate!"
It holds all my faith, and my beauty, and fate!

A box? No, my friend, it is truly a throne!
The King is who laughs, and who rules on his own!
Purrrrrrr...
