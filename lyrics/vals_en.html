Starlight is casting its shadows so gently,
Sunset is dying in far-away haze,
Silvery waves keep on beating so wearly,
Memory flows like the sand through my hands.

Dancing together we spun in wild dreaming,
Sweet was the spell that had clouded my eyes,
Stars and the heavens around us were swirling,
Waltzing in magical patterns tonight.

In silent night
Our forms unite,
And passion's wave
Makes me its slave.

Your proud glance bright,
Like falling star,
And southern bloom
Makes my head swoon.

In starlit haze,
Hell's flame and grace.
Each step we share -
Sweet poison there.

A stab! Your gaze
To him now strays,
Like steel so cold,
Through dark it pierced.

No words, no tears,
Just bitter threats,
And passion's fire
Now cold, expires.

Through starry deep
Your trace I seek,
But in that dance
I lost my chance.

Farewell! Take wing!
Find new heart's spring.
I'll wash away
Your trace by day.

One final spin,
Last circle in.
Then silence falls,
Through darkened halls.

Time, like the ashes of moments long burned,
Winds swept them far to the distances cold.
Sea keeps my secrets and doubts so securely,
Whispering tales of the years growing old.

Here by the shore under starlight eternal,
Night veils the lovers' sweet rustling of sin.
Faithful old dog, my companion nocturnal,
Knows without words what has always been.

Stars weave their songs in a sorrowful manner,
Waltz of infinity fades in the sea.
Leaving forever through midnight's dark shadow,
Each step transforms to a verse breaking free.
